- simply running sRead with ./sRead (# of reads) without modications
simply outputs e # of reads you inputted, with increasing delay as you
increase the number of reads
- upon changing the assertion statement to blockno-1, running the program fails
- upon adding the printf statement, the buf value corresponding block number is printed 
- times:
	10 reads: 0.112s
	100 reads: 1.094s
	1000 reads: 10.871s
	10000 reads: 46.926s
- increasing the number input simply requires CPU to do more reads, since this takes time
(request/write), time goes up
- increasing the number also increases the for-loop iteration amount, thus runtime increases

4)
- first tested through running pc_spinlock several times to make sure
the total number of item counts = 800 all the time, since the original set iterations number
is 200 and there is 4 processors and 2 of each producers and consumers threads
- then added assert statements to make sure the items count is between 0 and MAX_ITEMS
all the time, changing the iteration number and making sure all the above still is 
satisfied
- used the values of the wait counters and items histogram to see how many times the program
had to wait (producer or consumer) for the items count to be their desired states
before adding or subtracting from items (this is different every time as it depends on
who, producers or consumers get the lock first) (and if
producers or consumers wait more) and items histogram to see how times the different
items number appeared
